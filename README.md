These are a few projects I did during college. 
The project named Restaurant is for managing a restaurant where you can add, delete or read the products and orders.
The project named polinom is for calculating polinoms, where you can perform operations between 2 polinoms: add, multiply, decrease, derivation and integration.
The project named coada is for managing a queue with clients: the arrival time, waiting time, service time.
The other project is for managing a botanical garden. In this application, you can log in as a administrator, employee or just as a simple user. Only the administrator
can perform the CRUD operations. I used the Model-View-Controller architecture.
